# CSP-Problem

## Purpose
Program, which shows a constraint satisfaction problem with heuristics.


## What CSP-Problem provides?
- **Generic** backtracking, forwardchecking and AC3 algorithms
- **Generic** heuristcs for choosing variable and value
- The solution for coloring maps
- Can easly add another CSP (like sudoku) to the program, becouse CSP class is generic


## Research with comparing backtracking/forwardchecking with heuristics
Due to lack of time, heuristics aren't optimized 
(**But they work!** just skip the part, that they slow down algorithms >.<)
